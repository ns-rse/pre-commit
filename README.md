# pre-commit

Slides and files for a talk on using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) I was originally invited to give at [University
of Leeds Research Computing (2023-01-23)](https://ti.to/university-of-leeds-research-computing/techtalk-2023-pre-commit).

The RevealJS slides are written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) and published using a
GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows`.
