I’ve matured into this role after a convoluted career pathway via Statistical Genetics, Medical Statistics during which I developed a keen interest in reproducible research and started using Git.\nPrior to starting in my current role I spent a few years as a Data Scientist at a telematics company where I didn’t really do much data science but did learn Python, working collaboratively with Git and good practices for software development and engineering.\nI was invited here today by Alex Coleman, thank you Alex, on the back of a blog post I wrote pre-commit : Protecting your Future Self and the QR code will take you to the blog post if you’re quick enough to scan it before I move on."

We’ll then look at Git Hooks because they underpin the functionality of pre-commit and I’ll then go through installing and configuring pre-commit, hopefully give a demonstration that won’t fail and then show how pre-commit can be integrated into Continuous Integration and Development pipelines."
